Introduction

There are currently 710 registered crptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap. Crptocurrency has come a long way since the Bitcoin in 2009.
Many of them had gone inactive in development, some in a really slow phase, and a handful doing really well in terms of development.
Do we really need so many cryptocurrencies in this world we live in? It is foreseeable, more than 80% of these 710 cryptocurrencies 
would not be used in the world in future, and at the same time, the number of cryptocurrencies will grow massively in the next 5 years.
Cryptocurrency has a very huge potential for now, and it has the ability to change the world in terms of banking, payment and probably
more that we cannot imagine as of yet. And that is why, more cryptocurrencies with wonderful developers will come out in the near future
with many more wonderful ideas. So, why SoarCoin?





Ambition

By creating SoarCoin, we hope that, we'll be able to bring blockchain technology to the public easily. Instead of
developing complicated hashing algorithms and coming out with many complicated functions that public who does not have high level of IT
background can understand, SoarCoin is created so that, it can be implemented easily by shop owners, regardless of physical 
shop in malls, or online shopping websites, or even vendors in Amazon and similar platforms, and thus, making it easier for the public 
to adopt SoarCoin so long as they are willing.

At the moment, not enough is done about the many cryptocurrencies in the world. In most cases, such coins are only used for trading, and 
most would require a mining phase. Miners who see potential in such coins, spend a huge chunk of electricity and computing powers to mine
such coins. One would never know, if what they are mining now, can ever make it in the world as a game changer. 





Technical

SoarCoin is a smart contract token created on the Ethereum network. This means that, SoarCoin will leverage on the blockchain of Ethereum.
Thus, every transaction made using SoarCoin, it can be found in the block explorer of Ethereum. By doing so, it also means that transactions
can be approved and confirmed at a very fast speed and it'll be secure as it'll be verified by the countless of Ethereum nodes all around the
world. As SoarCoin will be leveraging on Ethereum's network, there wouldn't be a need to create a blockchain just for SoarCoin, and also
needless to create nodes to ensure the speed of transaction. 


-Wallets

Users will need to create and adopt Ethereum wallet first, before being able to use our coin. After doing so, by adding SoarCoin's contract
address in wallet, users will be able to receive and send out SoarCoin. Because of many wonderful developers in Ethereum, most of these
procederes can be completed easily and securely.


-Holders' Benefit (Proposed)

By holding SoarCoins, holders, such as shop vendors and shoppers, will get an interest on an annual basis. As SoarCoin will be used to 
replace the value of cash in future, interests for holders will be neccessary. This will encourage shop vendors to adopt SoarCoin at a
faster rate, at the same time, spenders will be encouraged to spend SoarCoin and start using SoarCoin as a paying method, instead of 
using fiat. In this case, the traditional paying method that requires a spender to pay more because of currency difference, would be
removed, and thus, it'll be easier for spenders to understand the actual value of something the spender would like to buy. Interest
payouts will. 

SoarCoin, at its initial stage, needs to be distributed differently compared to most decentralised tokens. For SoarCoin to reach its best
potential, SoarCoins will be distributed by participating vendors or companies. They will distribute SoarCoins to allow their loyal 
customers to use SoarCoins, and make transactions through their online platform. In the near future, businesses with shop fronts, might 
be able to accept payments as well using our wallet application. 

Such a way of distribution, may seem unfair to the public, especially to some who might be interested in having some SoarCoins token.
We'll be putting up 5-10% of the total supply of SoarCoins to be on sale on some exchanges. For each participating business, they can be
allocated up to 10% of total supply, depending on the scale of business. SoarCoins management team will have control over the distribution
by participating companies. So as to ensure the price of SoarCoin to remain stable, and most importantly, not be affected negatively
when companies release too much coins to the market. 

So, what happens when we've finished distributing all the SoarCoins? SoarCoin owns a mint token function. If it comes a time where SoarCoin
needs to be minted to cater to more businesses, it will be done in a delicate way. No doubt, dilution of price may occur. There exist many
ways to solve this issue, one way we can explore will be, instead of distributing a fixed share of 5-10% of total supply to businesses, a 
fixed share of the total supply, can instead be allocated for businesses. From the fixed share of total supply, new participating businesses
or companies will then be added to the pool, and shares will be distributed based on the allocated pool. Of course under this scenario,
participating businesses will not be allowed to hold or own any SoarCoins. Their role over here can only be a distributor of SoarCoin,
and merchants accepting SoarCoin as payment. 

However, none of these can be confirmed as SoarCoin needs to be as flexible as possible, in order to achieve a stable price in the crypto-
currency market. Implementations or actions taken in future will however, be along the line as mentioned above.



-Eligibility for interest payouts

  - User registration
  - Completing x number of transactions in a specific time frame, y.

By registering the Ethereum address of users, it'll be easier to keep track of users who're ready to take part in this game-chainging
way of payment in future. For every registered user, the user will receive a special token created. This special created token, will not be
transferrable. For users to qualify for interests, user will need to have this special token in the same wallet where SoarCoin is held.

No doubt, with interests for users, it means a dilution of total number of coins available. For SoarCoin to grow in value, users need 
use SoarCoin as a primary payment option when shopping with vendors who accepts SoarCoin as a payment option. Thus, it is justifiable for
users who completes x number of transactions within the designated time frame, to be able to receive interests as reward. 


-Transaction fees

As SoarCoin leverages on Ethereum's network and blockchain. It is definitely right, for transaction fees to be in Ethers. Thus, for users
to send SoarCoin, users will need to have a small amount of Ether in their wallet. These are called gas. For most transactions that will
take place using SoarCoin, the amount of gas to be used will be very insignificant. These may change in the future, and hopefully 
SoarCoin will be able to function without the need of transaction fees. After all, one of the reason Soarcoin should be adopted is because
to avoid paying for currency differences and other administrative fees.





Conclusion

SoarCoin is a cryptocurrency powered by the Ethereum Network. Ethereum is the future of the internet, with endless of possibilities.
SoarCoin have what it takes to change the future of payment, together with the future of internet, the possibility of how far SoarCoin
can go is limitless. The simplicity of SoarCoin will also encourage more adoption compared to other cryptocurrency out there. Ultimately,
SoarCoin hopes to unite traditional businesses of the online platform, and bring everybody to this new era of cryptocurrency.
